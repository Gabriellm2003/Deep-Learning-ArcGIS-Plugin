# Plugin instalation

The plugin instalation is quite easy. The only step needed is to copy this repository to the folder that ArcGis is installed. Typically it can be found in C:Users\Usename\Documents\ArcGIS DocumentosnArcGIS).
After that, open ArcGIS software and you'll be able to visualize the plugin on the right bar, as can be seen in the figure bellow.
